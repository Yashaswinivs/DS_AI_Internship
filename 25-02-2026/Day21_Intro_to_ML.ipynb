    "The goal of machine learning (ML) is to teach computers to recognize patterns in data rather than preprogramming them with rules. In machine learning, we offer the computer a lot of data together with the right answers, and it finds the rules and relationships on its own. In traditional coding, we give the computer precise instructions and logic to follow. ML models may generate predictions or decisions on fresh, unknown data by learning from examples, which enables systems to gradually improve their performance without being explicitly coded for every scenario."
