    "Today’s session focused on understanding the overall structure of the machine learning workflow instead of learning isolated daily topics. The goal was to connect all the concepts learned so far into a single, complete picture.\n",
    "\n",
    "We began with a comprehensive revision of the entire curriculum, which included:\n",
    "\n",
    "Data preprocessing (cleaning and preparing raw data)\n",
    "\n",
    "Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand data patterns and trends\n",
    "\n",
    "Different machine learning model architectures and their use cases\n",
    "\n",
    "This review helped reinforce how each stage fits into the end-to-end machine learning pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "After the revision, mentors introduced five different real-world problem statements for the capstone project. The objective was to select one project that best balances learning value, feasibility, and technical challenge.\n",
    "\n",
    "I analyzed each problem by considering:\n",
    "\n",
    "The type and size of data required\n",
    "\n",
    "The complexity of the problem\n",
    "\n",
    "The machine learning techniques needed\n",
    "\n",
    "The time and resources available\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on this analysis, I selected the most suitable problem statement for my capstone project, which I will work on in the coming days.\n",
    "\n",
    "This activity improved my analytical thinking, decision-making, and project planning skills, and helped me understand how to approach real-world machine learning problems in a structured way."
